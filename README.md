notes

aimbot's autoshoot "SO" mode is sniper specific, it only autoshoots when the sniper is scoped in.

for glow to work you must manually set the "glow_outline_effect_enable" convar to 1 (if it's not set to 1 already).

menu's open key is INSERT.

when the menu is active you can use the middle mouse button to drag it around (no need to hover over the menu).

left click - decreases the values of: ints, floats, aliases and/or toggles: bools, tabs.

right click - increases the values of: ints, floats, aliases.

holding the keys will dec/inc values quicker.

oh and don't forget to set Release/x86 when building and install Montserrat font.
